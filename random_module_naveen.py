"""
randint() is an inbuilt function of the random module in Python3.
Syntax : randint(start, end)
Parameters :
(start, end) : Both of them must be integer type values.
Returns :
A random integer within the given range as parameters.
Errors and Exceptions :

ValueError : Returns a ValueError when floating
             point values are passed as parameters.

TypeError : Returns a TypeError when anything other than
            numeric values are passed as parameters.
